There are currently seven permission groups that can be toggled:
Director, StageManager, AsstStageManager, Light, Sound, StageCrew, Actor


If you see something like [REPLACE_ME_HERE], then that is where you would put the actual data.

To insert permissions for a user, do:
INSERT INTO `theatreappsuite`.`permissions` (`UserID`, `PlayID`) VALUES ('[USERID_HERE]', '[PLAYID_HERE]');
All permission groups will be disabled by default.
// NOTE: THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR EVERY USER INVOLVED IN A PLAY //
// USERID AND PLAYID ARE THE ARBITRARY NUMBERS FROM THE DB,      //
// NOT THEIR CALVIN ID AND PLAY NAME                             //



To read permissions for a user, do:
SELECT * FROM `theatreappsuite`.`permissions` WHERE `UserID` = "[USERID_HERE]" AND `PlayID` = "[PLAYID_HERE]"
This will return all permissions for a given user in a given play.



To enable a permission group for a user, do:
UPDATE `theatreappsuite`.`permissions` SET `[PERMISSION_GROUP_NAME_HERE]`="1" WHERE `UserID` = "[USERID_HERE]" AND `PlayID` = "[PLAYID_HERE]";
To disable a permission group for a user, do:
UPDATE `theatreappsuite`.`permissions` SET `[PERMISSION_GROUP_NAME_HERE]`="0" WHERE `UserID` = "[USERID_HERE]" AND `PlayID` = "[PLAYID_HERE]";



To delete permissions for a user, do:
DELETE FROM `theatreappsuite`.`user` WHERE `UserID` = "[USERID_HERE]" AND `PlayID` = "[PLAYID_HERE]";
