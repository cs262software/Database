NOTE: The backend team is responsible for hashing and salting user passwords! DO NOT STORE THE PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT.
// AGAIN, DO NOT STORE THE PASSWORDS IN PLAIN TEXT //

If you see something like [REPLACE_ME_HERE], then that is where you would put the actual data.



To create a new user, do:
INSERT INTO `theatreappsuite`.`user` (`UserName`, `Password`, `FirstName`, `LastName`) VALUES ('[CALVIN_ID_HERE]', '[SALTED_PASSWORD_HERE], '[FIRST_NAME_HERE]', '[LAST_NAME_HERE]'');
Or if they don't want to input their name:
INSERT INTO `theatreappsuite`.`user` (`UserName`, `Password`) VALUES ('[CALVIN_ID_HERE]', '[SALTED_PASSWORD_HERE]');
// NOTE: THIS ONLY ADDS A NEW USER, IT DOES NOT SET UP PERMISSIONS    //
// PLEASE SEE THE CRUD COMMANDS FOR PERMISSIONS AND USE THOSE AS WELL //


To read a user, do:
SELECT * FROM `theatreappsuite`.`user` WHERE `UserName` = "[CALVIN_ID_HERE]";
This will return the UserID, UserName, their name, and their password.
To get just their name, do:
SELECT `FirstName`, `LastName` FROM `theatreappsuite`.`user` WHERE `UserName` = "[CALVIN_ID_HERE]";
To get just their salted password hash, do:
SELECT `Password` FROM `theatreappsuite`.`user` WHERE `UserName` = "[CALVIN_ID_HERE]";
To get just their UserID, do:
SELECT `UserID` FROM `theatreappsuite`.`user` WHERE `UserName` = "[CALVIN_ID_HERE]";
// THE USERID IS VERY IMPORTANT AND IS USED FOR ALL OTHER LOOKUPS //
// I WOULD RECOMMEND STORING THIS IN MEMORY WHEN THE USER IS LOGGED IN //


To update a user, do:
UPDATE `theatreappsuite`.`user` SET [SEE_BELOW_FOR_THIS_HERE] WHERE `UserName` = "[CALVIN_ID_HERE]";
You can replace the block above with one or more of the below, separated by commas:
`FirstName`="[FIRST_NAME_HERE]",`LastName`="[LAST_NAME_HERE]",`Password`="[SALTED_PASSWORD_HERE]"



To delete a user, do:
DELETE FROM `theatreappsuite`.`user` WHERE `UserName` = "[CALVIN_ID_HERE]";
